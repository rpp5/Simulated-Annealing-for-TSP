# Simulated-Annealing-for-TSP

Optimization problems are present across a wide range of fields, from operations research and computer science to physics and machine learning. Among the many approaches to tackle these problems, simulated annealing (SA) stands out as a particularly powerful and versatile method. Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given func-
tion. Inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, where materials are heated and slowly cooled to remove defects and improve structural integrity, SA emulates this process to find optimal or near-optimal solutions in large and complex search spaces.

One of the key strengths of simulated annealing is its ability to escape local optima, a challenge faced by many other optimization algorithms like gradient descent. By allowing occasional acceptance of worse solutions during the search process, SA maintains exploration diversity and increases the likelihood of discovering the global optimum. This ability makes it especially useful for combinatorial optimization problems, where the search space is discrete and riddled with numerous local optima. Simulated annealing has been successfully
applied to a variety of real-world applications, including scheduling, circuit design, network optimization, and machine learning model tuning. In this discussion, we will focus on applying simulated annealing to one of the most well-known and challenging combinatorial optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
